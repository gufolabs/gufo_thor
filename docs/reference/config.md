# thor.yml Configuration Reference

This topic describes `thor.yml` file format version `1.0`.

`thor.yml` is [YAML][YAML] file defining:

* [version](#version)
* [project](#project)
* [noc](#noc)
* [expose](#expose)
* [pools](#pools)
* [services](#services)
* [labs](#labs)

## version

File format version. Must have value `1.0`.

``` yaml
version: "1.0"
```

## project

Project name. Defines docker containers name prefix. Used
to distingush container names when multiple thor projects
are used on same host. By default, the name of directory
in which the `thor.yml` file locates is used as project name.

``` yaml
project: mynoc
```

## NOC Section { #noc }

Defines common noc configuration.

### tag { #noc-tag }

Defines docker image tag. Default value is `master`.

``` yaml
noc:
    tag: "24.1"
```

### path { #noc-path }

NOC source code path to override container's `/opt/noc`.
Used for development and allows to expose local changes
directly in container.

``` yaml
noc:
    path: /home/joe/work/noc
```

### custom { #noc-custom }

NOC custom code path. Allows to mount NOC customizations
from local host.

``` yaml
noc:

```

### installation_name { #noc-installation-name }

## Expose Section { #expose }

Web interface entrypoint configuration.

### domain_name { #expose-domain-name }

Domain name for web interface. By default has the value `go.getnoc.com`
which techninally resolves to the localhost. When using default domain
name the Gufo Thor is able to sign the domain certificate in fully
transparent manner.

!!! warning

    If you wish to change the `domain_name` you have to
    generate private key and sign the certificate by yourself.

``` yaml
expose:
    domain_name: go.getnoc.com
```

### web { #expose-web }

Web interface address and port.

```
expose:
    web:

``` yaml
pools:
  subnet: 10.0.2.0/24
```

### subnet { #pools-subnet }

## Labs Section {#labs}

Defines network labs. Each lab contains network nodes and links.

Example:

```yaml
labs:
  lab1:
    pool: test
    nodes:
      r1:
